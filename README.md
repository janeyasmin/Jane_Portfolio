# [Project 1: Automate Spotify Playlist with Python: Project Overview](https://github.com/janeyasmin/Spotify-meets-Python-) 
* Created a tool that extracts the songs that won the "Best Melodic Rap Performances" Grammy category from a web database and gathers them in a Spotify playlist.
* Scraped the songs titles and respective artists from a web article based on their formatting, using the BeautifulSoup library.
* Used the Spotipy library in parallel with the Spotify for Developer's Web API to acquire authentication token, create and add tracks to playlist and obtain track URI'S.
